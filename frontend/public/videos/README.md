# Hero video

Home page hero section uses a **muted, autoplay, loop** background video (Apollo-style).

- Add your video file as: **`hero.mp4`** in this folder (`public/videos/hero.mp4`).
- Recommended: short loop (15–30 sec), healthcare/hospital theme, MP4 (H.264).
- Keep file size moderate for fast loading (e.g. under 5–10 MB).

If `hero.mp4` is missing, the hero will still show the gradient background and all text/buttons.
